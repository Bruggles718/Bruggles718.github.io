                If I had more time to work on this project, I think I would have liked to expand on my physics engine further. I would have liked to add rotational inertia and momentum in order to create more complex simulations. I would also like to add a more stable form of integration, as the symplectic euler integration I am currently using is prone to instability. I would have also liked to add the ability to use concave colliders, but this would require a lot of extra work. I think it also would have been cool to add some kind of spatial partitioning in order to increase the amount of colliders I can have in the world at once. I also would have wanted to add collision groups to allow for putting colliders on different layers and only processing collisions for colliders that are on the same layer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also would have liked to add sound, UI elements, and rendering layers. I feel that those are pretty basic features that all engines should have that I just unfortunately didn't have time to get to. I also would have liked to give game objects the ability to have child objects so their transform's could be inherited. I think I would have liked to expand this capability to the camera as well, as currently, the only way to interact with the camera and make it move is through scripting. I think it would be cool if a camera object could inherit the transform of an object it is the child of. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I would have also liked to support objects having multiple of a certain type of component. In some cases this can be done already depending on the component, but I think it would have been nice if more components could abide by this feature. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I would have also liked to expand on my editor more. While I feel I made something very robust, I still found myself wishing I could have added certain features as I was making my three scenes for this project. I would have liked to allow for more use of the mouse, and less typing in of values directly. I think that would make it more usable. I would also have liked to allow referencing one game object in the script component of another game object so they can interact through scripting. I would also have liked to add the use of loading prefabs in the editor to allow for template objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I think it would be really really cool to make my engine 3D someday. I think after I've taken Computer Graphics, I'll feel more confident in my ability to do this, but right now, I just don't have the knowledge or skills to properly implement it. However, I think supporting 3D would really take my engine to the next level and allow for the creation of so many types of games.
